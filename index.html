         <div class="short_desc">Hello! If you read those rows that means you right on <a target="_self" rel="noopener" title="" href="./">these site, huh?</a><br>
         Okay, let's start.<br> I'm Dmitriy Shtanenko from Russia, 29 years old and I'm working for Kelly Services IT Solutions (as external employee for Danone company).br
         My hobbies are not so obvious or interesting (imho): I'm interested at games, music, learning a some new (for example languages), bicycling at summer times. I'll tell about them in the future in more details (maybe). <br>
         As external worker I work on position "Information Technology Specialist". This include, but doesn't exclude:
          <ul>
            <li>Help for colleagues with software and hardware</li>
            <li>Diagnosting and resolving technical issues with devices in my responsibility</li>
            <li>Maintenance hardware such as MFP, desktops, laptops, Zebra scanners, monitors, iPads</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li>And other urgent or special requests from my direct manager</li>
          </ul></p>
          <div class="about">This page are in developing and will be filled more content a little bit later. Also I'm going to create a several pages with different design (via CSS3). <br>
         I didn't have an any special skills or learning courses like Coursera in web-developing, so this project will be a huge for me as junior in web-developing.<br>
         My previous project, honestly, was interesting but it absolutely doesn't fit for public project.<br>
         Why? Because it's a little database with my work information.<br>
         I can not put it in public access also with password-protected pages (Yeah, with apache-config).<br><br><br>
         That's all for now.<br>
           <span>To be continued...</span></p><p class="smile"><a title="" href="./CV.html"> ^_^</a> </div>
